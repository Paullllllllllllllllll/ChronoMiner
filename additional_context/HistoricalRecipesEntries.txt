ADDITIONAL CONTEXT FOR HISTORICAL RECIPES ENTRIES

When extracting data from historical recipes, please consider:

1. Recipe structure variations:
   - Medieval and early modern recipes often lack precise measurements
   - Ingredient lists may be embedded in narrative instructions rather than separate
   - Cooking times may be expressed as "until done" or "the time it takes to say a prayer"
   - Equipment may be implied rather than explicitly stated
   - Yields/servings often unspecified or expressed in vague terms

2. Language and terminology:
   - Archaic ingredient names (e.g., "manchet" for fine wheat bread, "verjuice" for sour grape juice)
   - Historical measurement units (livres, onces, pintes, handfuls, pinches)
   - Cooking method terms may differ from modern usage (e.g., "seethe" for boil)
   - Preserve original spelling and diacritics exactly as they appear
   - Many ingredients have regional or period-specific names

3. Ingredient categories and social context:
   - Meat, poultry, and fish indicate dietary patterns and religious observance
   - Expensive spices (saffron, cinnamon, pepper) signal luxury or high-status cuisine
   - Butter vs. olive oil vs. lard indicates regional culinary traditions
   - Refined sugar availability marks historical period (post-colonial trade)
   - Dairy and eggs important for dietary and religious classification (Lenten restrictions)
   - Alcohol usage (wine, beer, spirits) varies by region and religious context

4. Cooking methods and equipment:
   - Open hearth cooking dominant until 18th-19th century
   - Roasting, boiling, and baking most common until modern period
   - Specialized equipment (spits, trivets, kettles) indicates kitchen sophistication
   - Mortars and pestles ubiquitous for grinding and mixing
   - Copper and clay vessels mentioned in older recipes

5. Recipe types and classifications:
   - Main dishes vs. side dishes vs. desserts (categories may be anachronistic)
   - Fast day vs. feast day recipes crucial for medieval/early modern contexts
   - Court cuisine vs. bourgeois vs. peasant cooking represents social stratification
   - Medicinal recipes often mixed with culinary ones in early cookbooks
   - Preserving and pickling recipes important for pre-refrigeration food storage

6. Quantities and standardization:
   - Historical measurements require conversion to modern units when possible
   - "To taste" or unspecified quantities very common
   - Recipe scaling often unclear - portions for households of varying sizes
   - Ingredient ratios more important than absolute quantities in many recipes

7. Translation considerations:
   - Provide both original language and modern English translations
   - Cooking method terms may lack direct modern equivalents
   - Ingredient names may require cultural/botanical context for accurate translation
   - Preserve ambiguity when historical text is unclear
   - Note when ingredients are no longer commonly available

This additional context should help you accurately extract historical recipes while preserving their original
character and providing useful standardized information for analysis.
