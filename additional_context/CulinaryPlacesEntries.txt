   - Historical addresses may no longer exist or may have been renumbered
   - Regional identifications important for understanding culinary traditions
   - Urban vs. rural contexts affect food production and consumption patterns
   - Transportation networks (ports, rail, roads) relevant to food distribution
   - Micro-geographic details: neighborhoods, districts, street-level locations

3. Temporal dimensions and change over time:
   - Founding dates, periods of operation, closure or transformation dates
   - Evolution of establishments (ownership changes, renovations, concept shifts)
   - Impact of historical events (wars, economic crises, social changes) on places

   - Long-duration institutions vs. ephemeral establishments
   - Historical reputation vs. contemporary assessments

4. Culinary and cultural significance:

   - Role in broader food systems (production, distribution, consumption)
   - Cultural and social memory attached to places

5. Physical and spatial characteristics:

7. Secondary literature approaches:
   - Urban history perspectives emphasize places in city development

   - Business history focuses on economic organization and entrepreneurship
   - Cultural history explores meanings, representations, and memory
   - Food history connects places to broader culinary systems and traditions
   - Local history provides detailed micro-level documentation

8. Documentation and source considerations:
   - Visual sources (photographs, drawings, maps, advertisements) often discussed
   - Business records, menus, price lists may be cited or quoted
   - Contemporary descriptions from travelers, journalists, or diarists
   - Official records (tax documents, licenses, censuses) provide factual data
   - Oral histories and memories add personal perspectives
   - Archaeological evidence for historical production sites

This additional context should help you accurately extract information about culinary places from secondary
literature, capturing both factual details and broader historical significance while recognizing the
interpretive nature of scholarly discussions.
