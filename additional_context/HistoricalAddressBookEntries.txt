When extracting address book data, consider these historical aspects:

1. Street naming conventions:
   - Historical street names often changed over time due to political shifts
   - Many streets were named after local notables, professions, or geographical features
   - Some streets had unofficial local names alongside official designations

2. Occupation classifications:
   - Pre-industrial occupations may not match modern job categories
   - Many occupations were highly specialized (e.g., different types of smiths)
   - Status indicators were often embedded in occupation descriptions

3. Addressing formats:
   - House numbers were not universally used until the late 18th/early 19th century
   - Some locations used plot numbers or local landmarks instead of street numbers
   - Multiple families or businesses often shared a single address

4. Honorifics and titles:
   - Honorifics indicated social class, profession, and sometimes marital status
   - Academic titles were highly prestigious and always noted
   - Religious and military titles were commonly used alongside civilian ones

This additional context should help you better interpret and extract historical address book entries with greater accuracy.
