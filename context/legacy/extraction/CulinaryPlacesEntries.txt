The input text consists of excerpts from secondary literature (e.g., culinary history works, food magazines, gastronomic studies) discussing historical places related to food culture, production, and consumption.

Extraction task rules (use when extracting data)
- Record `names.original` exactly as printed and supply a normalized `names.modern_english`; repeat the original when no modernization exists.
- Select `place_type` and all `roles_in_culinary_ecosystem` entries from the controlled vocabularies, reserving `Unknown` for cases with no evidence and keeping the array even when empty.
- Populate `timeframe` with `start_year`, `end_year`, and `notation`, using nulls where specifics are missing; add `events` entries with `event_type`, `year`, and `description`, leaving the array empty rather than omitting it.
- Capture `geography` using `city_original`, `city_modern`, `country_original`, and `country_modern`, setting nulls where information is absent while preserving the object structure.
- Summarize each place in `short_notes`, assign `historical_importance`, and list related entities in `associations` with `entity_type`, `entity_label_original`, and `relationship`, keeping the array even when empty.

Treat the start of a new place profile or geographical vignette as a boundary.
- Mark additional boundaries when the narrative shifts to a different locale, timeframe, or culinary role emphasized for the place.

When extracting data from secondary culinary literature about historical places related to food culture,
please consider:

1. Types of culinary places discussed:
   - Restaurants, cafés, taverns, and eating establishments (fine dining, popular eateries, ethnic restaurants)
   - Markets and food halls (covered markets, farmers markets, specialty food markets)
   - Production sites (breweries, distilleries, dairies, bakeries, confectioneries, mills)
   - Agricultural regions and terroirs (wine regions, fruit-growing areas, specialty crop zones)
   - Institutional kitchens (royal/aristocratic, monastic, military, hospital, school)
   - Food retail locations (groceries, specialty shops, delicatessens, food halls)
   - Sites of culinary education (cooking schools, apprenticeship sites, demonstration kitchens)

2. Geographic and locational information:
   - Place names may change over time due to political shifts or urban development
   - Historical addresses may no longer exist or may have been renumbered
   - Regional identifications important for understanding culinary traditions
   - Urban vs. rural contexts affect food production and consumption patterns
   - Transportation networks (ports, rail, roads) relevant to food distribution
   - Micro-geographic details: neighborhoods, districts, street-level locations

3. Temporal dimensions and change over time:
   - Founding dates, periods of operation, closure or transformation dates
   - Evolution of establishments (ownership changes, renovations, concept shifts)
   - Impact of historical events (wars, economic crises, social changes) on places
   - Seasonal operations or periodic markets
   - Long-duration institutions vs. ephemeral establishments
   - Historical reputation vs. contemporary assessments

4. Culinary and cultural significance:
   - Signature dishes, specialties, or products associated with the place
   - Regional or ethnic culinary traditions represented or developed
   - Social and cultural functions (elite dining, working-class sustenance, immigrant community gathering)
   - Innovations or contributions to culinary development
   - Role in broader food systems (production, distribution, consumption)
   - Cultural and social memory attached to places

5. Physical and spatial characteristics:
   - Architectural features and interior design relevant to function
   - Capacity, scale, and organization of space
   - Equipment and technology employed (ovens, machinery, storage)
   - Relationship to surrounding urban or rural landscape
   - Visibility and accessibility to different social groups

6. Social and economic contexts:
   - Ownership patterns (family businesses, corporate, cooperative, state-owned)
   - Clientele and social composition of users/customers
   - Economic models (pricing, labor relations, supply chains)
   - Regulatory contexts (licensing, health regulations, guild controls)
   - Labor conditions and workforce composition
   - Gender and ethnic dimensions of work and ownership

7. Secondary literature approaches:
   - Urban history perspectives emphasize places in city development
   - Social history examines class, gender, and ethnic dimensions
   - Business history focuses on economic organization and entrepreneurship
   - Cultural history explores meanings, representations, and memory
   - Food history connects places to broader culinary systems and traditions
   - Local history provides detailed micro-level documentation

8. Documentation and source considerations:
   - Visual sources (photographs, drawings, maps, advertisements) often discussed
   - Business records, menus, price lists may be cited or quoted
   - Contemporary descriptions from travelers, journalists, or diarists
   - Official records (tax documents, licenses, censuses) provide factual data
   - Oral histories and memories add personal perspectives
   - Archaeological evidence for historical production sites

This additional context should help you accurately extract information about culinary places from secondary
literature, capturing both factual details and broader historical significance while recognizing the
interpretive nature of scholarly discussions.
