The input text consists of bibliographic records describing historical culinary and household literature (e.g., cookbooks, household manuals, foodstuff guides, food production regulations, etc.) dated from approximately 1470 to 1950.

EXTRACTION RULES:
- Take the title and main author from the first edition for `full_title`, `short_title`, and `main_author`.
- Put every edition, including the first, into `edition_info` as its own object.
- When multiple editions describe the same work, keep them together under the same root entry.

BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONVENTIONS AND EVOLUTION:
- Pre-1800 bibliographies often follow Short Title Catalogue conventions
- Modern bibliographic standards (e.g., Chicago, MLA) emerged in late 19th/early 20th century
- Title pages may contain extensive subtitles describing contents and intended audience
- Printer and publisher information varied significantly across periods and regions
- Place of publication often indicated by city name in Latin or vernacular languages

EDITION TRACKING AND IDENTIFICATION:
- First editions are bibliographically distinct from reprints and revised editions
- Edition statements may appear in various forms: "tweede druk," "2nd edition," "revised and enlarged"
- Later editions often indicate changes: "with additions," "corrected edition," "newly revised"
- Posthumous editions may include editorial notes or additional material
- Translation editions require careful tracking of both original and translated publication details

HISTORICAL COOKBOOK CHARACTERISTICS:
- Early cookbooks (1470-1700) were often compiled from manuscript sources
- 18th-century works frequently claimed noble or aristocratic authorship for prestige
- 19th-century domestic manuals combined recipes with household management advice
- Commercial promotional cookbooks emerged with industrial food production
- Regional and ethnic cookbooks became distinct categories in late 19th/early 20th century

LANGUAGE AND ORTHOGRAPHY:
- Historical spelling varies significantly (e.g., Dutch "kookboek" vs. "cock-boeck")
- Multilingual regions produced works in multiple languages (Dutch, French, German, Latin)
- Diacritics and special characters must be preserved for accurate identification
- Title capitalization conventions changed over time and across languages
- Abbreviations in titles and imprint information follow period-specific patterns

SPECIAL CATEGORIES:
- Household manuals (combining cookery with medicine, household management)
- Confectionery and pastry-specific works (banketbakkers-boeken)
- Commercial recipe pamphlets and promotional booklets
- Regional compilations (e.g., Dutch East Indies cookbooks)
- Professional vs. domestic audience works (guild cookbooks vs. family manuals)

COMMON CHALLENGES:
- Cookbooks as "use books" often lost or damaged, making surviving copies rare
- Anonymous or pseudonymous authorship (e.g., "by a Lady," "by an experienced cook")
- Undated editions, especially in commercial promotional materials
- Variant issues within same edition with different title pages or bindings
- Series publications that spanned multiple years or volumes
