The input text consists of excerpts from secondary literature (e.g., culinary history works, food magazines, gastronomic studies) discussing historical cooks, gastronomes, and culinary instructors.

Extraction task rules (use when extracting data)
- Record `names.original` exactly as written and supply a standardized `names.modern_english`; if no modern form exists, repeat the original.
- Capture `short_notes`, populate `timeframe` and `lifespan` objects with `start_year`/`end_year` or `birth_year`/`death_year`, and use nulls where values are missing while preserving the object structures.
- Populate `cultural_identity` with `nationality_original`, `nationality_modern`, and `religious_tradition`; set nulls when evidence is lacking.
- Choose a `gender` value from the schema list, fill `roles` with all applicable controlled terms, assign `historical_importance`, and retain empty arrays instead of omitting them.
- Record each associated entity in `associations` with `entity_type`, `entity_label_original`, and `relationship`, keeping the array even when empty and using `geography` to store `city_*` and `country_*` values with nulls when absent.

Treat the start of a description about a new historical person as a boundary.

When extracting data from secondary culinary literature about historical culinary figures, please consider:

1. Types of culinary figures discussed:

   - Food entrepreneurs and restaurateurs
   - Culinary reformers and dietary advocates
   - Guild masters and craft instructors (confectioners, bakers, butchers)

2. Biographical information patterns:
   - Name variants across languages and time periods (birth names, professional names, pseudonyms)
   - Dates may be approximate or contested in secondary literature
   - Geographic mobility: training locations, career moves, emigration patterns
   - Social origins and class backgrounds often discussed for historical context
   - Gender considerations: women's culinary work often underrepresented in historical sources
   - Ethnic and national identities relevant to culinary traditions and influences

3. Professional activities and achievements:
   - Career positions: court appointments, restaurant ownership, institutional roles
   - Publications: cookbooks, articles, periodical contributions, translations
   - Innovations: recipe development, technique refinement, ingredient introductions
   - Training and mentorship: apprenticeships, schools established, notable students
   - Awards, recognition, and professional memberships
   - Business ventures: restaurants, catering services, product endorsements

4. Culinary contributions and influence:
   - Signature dishes or techniques attributed to the figure
   - Recipe collections or culinary styles associated with their work
   - Influence on regional, national, or international cuisine development
   - Adaptations or innovations of traditional practices
   - Cross-cultural culinary exchanges and fusion developments
   - Educational or reformist impacts on culinary practices

5. Secondary literature characteristics:
   - Modern scholarly works may contextualize figures within broader social/cultural history
   - Popular culinary histories often emphasize narrative and anecdotal elements
   - Biographical dictionaries provide condensed factual summaries
   - Magazine articles may focus on specific aspects (recipes, restaurants, innovations)
   - Academic research emphasizes archival sources and historiographic debates
   - Contemporary assessments may differ from historical reputation

6. Contextual information to extract:
   - Historical period and geographic location of activity
   - Social and cultural contexts (class structures, gender norms, economic conditions)
   - Culinary traditions and regional food cultures engaged with
   - Professional networks and institutional affiliations
   - Relationships with patrons, employers, audiences, or students
   - Legacy and continued influence on later culinary developments

7. Common challenges in secondary sources:
   - Conflicting information across different secondary sources
   - Mythologizing or romanticizing of historical culinary figures
   - Attribution debates for recipes, techniques, or innovations
   - Limited primary source documentation for some figures
   - Bias toward elite or male culinary professionals in older scholarship
   - Translation issues when discussing figures across multiple language traditions

This additional context should help you accurately extract biographical and professional information about
culinary figures from secondary literature, while maintaining awareness of historiographic complexities and
scholarly debates.
