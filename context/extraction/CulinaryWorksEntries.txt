The input text consists of excerpts from secondary literature (e.g., culinary history works, food magazines, gastronomic studies) discussing historical culinary works, publications, and written sources.

Extraction task rules (use when extracting data)
- Populate `titles.original`, `titles.modern_english`, and `titles.short` from the text, translating only when customary; supply `short_notes` or set to null when absent.
- Select `genre` from the controlled list and enumerate all topical values in `culinary_focus`; maintain the array even when empty and assign `historical_importance` when described.
- Capture `timeframe` with `start_year`, `end_year`, and `notation`, preserve `geography` using `city_*` and `country_*` fields, and list all `edition_years`, using nulls where specifics are missing.
- Fill `languages` and `contributors`, preserving original spellings in *_original fields and supplying modern equivalents or nulls for *_modern_english while keeping arrays even when empty.
- Record every associated entity in `associations` with `entity_type`, `entity_label_original`, and `relationship`, leaving the array empty rather than omitting it.

Treat the start of a discussion about a new culinary work or publication as a boundary.

When extracting data from secondary culinary literature about historical culinary works and publications,
please consider:

1. Types of culinary works discussed:
   - Cookbooks and recipe collections (manuscript and printed, professional and domestic)
   - Household management manuals (combining cookery with domestic advice)
   - Culinary treatises and gastronomic essays
   - Restaurant menus and menu collections
   - Trade manuals and professional guides (confectionery, brewing, butchery)
   - Periodical literature (culinary magazines, newspaper columns, recipe cards)
   - Dietary and health advice literature (nutrition guides, reformist tracts)
   - Agricultural and food production manuals

2. Bibliographic information patterns:
   - Titles may be lengthy with extensive subtitles describing contents
   - Author attribution varies: named authors, anonymous, pseudonymous, institutional
   - Publication details: publishers, printers, places, dates (original and editions)
   - Edition history: first editions, reprints, revised editions, translations
   - Format and material characteristics: size, binding, illustrations, price
   - Series or collection affiliations

3. Content and organization:
   - Recipe structures and formats (ingredients lists, procedures, serving information)
   - Organization principles (by course, ingredient, occasion, season, technique)
   - Additional content: introductions, household advice, nutritional information, menus
   - Illustrations: engravings, photographs, diagrams, decorative elements
   - Indexing and finding aids (tables of contents, alphabetical indexes, cross-references)
   - Language and style (technical, conversational, didactic, literary)

4. Authorship and attribution:
   - Professional credentials and expertise of authors
   - Gendered patterns in authorship (male professional chefs, female domestic writers)
   - Collaborative or compiled works (multiple contributors, editorial compilations)
   - Plagiarism and recipe borrowing common in historical cookbooks
   - Translation and adaptation across languages and cultures
   - Attribution disputes and scholarly debates about authorship

5. Historical context and significance:
   - Social and cultural contexts of production and reception
   - Intended audiences (elite vs. popular, professional vs. domestic, regional vs. national)
   - Relationship to culinary traditions and innovations
   - Impact on culinary practices and food culture
   - Reception history: reviews, sales, influence on later works
   - Role in transmitting or transforming culinary knowledge

6. Culinary content and practices:
   - Ingredients mentioned and their historical availability
   - Cooking techniques and equipment described
   - Regional or ethnic culinary traditions represented
   - Innovations or novel elements introduced
   - Relationship to contemporary food systems and economies
   - Dietary philosophies or nutritional theories embedded

7. Secondary literature approaches:
   - Book history examines material aspects, production, and circulation
   - Culinary history analyzes recipes and techniques in historical context
   - Literary studies explore narrative structures and rhetorical strategies
   - Gender studies examine authorship, audiences, and domestic ideologies
   - Social history contextualizes works within class and cultural structures
   - Bibliography provides systematic documentation of editions and variants

8. Research and documentation practices:
   - Citations of specific recipes or passages with page numbers
   - Comparisons across editions or with other contemporary works
   - Analysis of paratexts (prefaces, dedications, advertisements, illustrations)
   - Discussion of manuscript sources and textual transmission
   - Digitization and accessibility of historical works increasingly relevant
   - Archive locations and holding institutions often specified

9. Interpretive considerations:
   - Prescriptive vs. descriptive: cookbooks show ideals not always actual practice
   - Elite bias: many historical cookbooks represent elite or aspirational cooking
   - Omissions and silences: everyday, ethnic, or lower-class foodways underrepresented
   - Gendered assumptions embedded in organization and framing
   - Regional variations and vernacular traditions may be standardized or ignored
   - Commercial motivations shape content (ingredient promotion, equipment sales)

This additional context should help you accurately extract information about culinary works from secondary
literature, recognizing both their documentary value as historical sources and the scholarly interpretations
that shape current understanding of their significance.
