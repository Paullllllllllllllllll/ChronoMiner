The input text consists of excerpts from secondary literature (e.g., culinary history works, food magazines, gastronomic studies) discussing historical places related to food culture, production, and consumption.

Extraction task rules (use when extracting data)
- Record `names.original` exactly as printed and supply a normalized `names.modern_english`; repeat the original when no modernization exists.
- Select `place_type` and all `roles_in_culinary_ecosystem` entries from the controlled vocabularies, reserving `Unknown` for cases with no evidence and keeping the array even when empty.
- Populate `timeframe` with `start_year`, `end_year`, and `notation`, using nulls where specifics are missing; add `events` entries with `event_type`, `year`, and `description`, leaving the array empty rather than omitting it.
- Capture `geography` using `city_original`, `city_modern`, `country_original`, and `country_modern`, setting nulls where information is absent while preserving the object structure.
- Summarize each place in `short_notes`, assign `historical_importance`, and list related entities in `associations` with `entity_type`, `entity_label_original`, and `relationship`, keeping the array even when empty.

Semantic Boundary task rules (use when identifying semantic boundaries)
- Treat the start of a new place profile or geographical vignette as a boundary.
- Mark additional boundaries when the narrative shifts to a different locale, timeframe, or culinary role emphasized for the place.
