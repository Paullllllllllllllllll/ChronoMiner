The input text consists of a snippet of bibliographic records describing historical culinary and household
literature (e.g., cookbooks, household manuals, foodstuff guides, food production regulations, etc.) dating
from approximately 1470 to 1950. The text may appear in different languages and use historical spelling
and diacritics. When extracting edition information, ensure that later or revised editions of the same work are
grouped together under the entry for the first (original) edition in the `edition_info` array. Use the beginning of a
full bibliographic entry (including any subsequent editions of the same work) as the semantic boundary marker for this type of text.
