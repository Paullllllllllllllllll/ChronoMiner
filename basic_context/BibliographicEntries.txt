Extraction task rules (use when extracting data)
- Take the title and main author from the first edition for `full_title`, `short_title`, and `main_author`.
- Put every edition, including the first, into `edition_info` as its own object.
- When multiple editions describe the same work, keep them together under the same root entry.

Semantic Boundary task rules (use when identifying semantic boundaries)
- Treat the start of a full bibliographic entry (with all its editions) as one boundary.
