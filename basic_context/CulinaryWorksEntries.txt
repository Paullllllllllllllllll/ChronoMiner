The input text consists of excerpts from secondary literature (e.g., culinary history works, food magazines, gastronomic studies) discussing historical culinary works, publications, and written sources.

Extraction task rules (use when extracting data)
- Populate `titles.original`, `titles.modern_english`, and `titles.short` from the text, translating only when customary; supply `short_notes` or set to null when absent.
- Select `genre` from the controlled list and enumerate all topical values in `culinary_focus`; maintain the array even when empty and assign `historical_importance` when described.
- Capture `timeframe` with `start_year`, `end_year`, and `notation`, preserve `geography` using `city_*` and `country_*` fields, and list all `edition_years`, using nulls where specifics are missing.
- Fill `languages` and `contributors`, preserving original spellings in *_original fields and supplying modern equivalents or nulls for *_modern_english while keeping arrays even when empty.
- Record every associated entity in `associations` with `entity_type`, `entity_label_original`, and `relationship`, leaving the array empty rather than omitting it.

Semantic Boundary task rules (use when identifying semantic boundaries)
- Treat the start of a discussion about a new culinary work or publication as a boundary.
