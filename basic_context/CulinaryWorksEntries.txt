The input text consists of excerpts from secondary literature (e.g., culinary history works, food magazines, gastronomic studies) discussing historical culinary works, publications, and written sources.

Extraction task rules (use when extracting data)
- Capture `title_original`, `title_modern_english`, and `short_title` directly from the text, translating only when customary; populate `description` with concise summaries or set to null when absent.
- Select `genre` from the controlled list and enumerate all topical values in `culinary_focus`; maintain the array even when empty.
- Fill `languages`, `contributors`, `edition_years`, and `publication_places`, preserving original spellings in *_original fields and supplying modern equivalents or nulls for *_modern_english.
- Record every `associated_place` and `associated_person`, using the provided structure with `association_type`; retain `notes` and `links` arrays even when empty.
- When the source omits data, use nulls or empty arrays instead of dropping fields to satisfy schema requirements.

Semantic Boundary task rules (use when identifying semantic boundaries)
- Treat the start of a discussion about a new culinary work or publication as a boundary.
