The input text consists of a snippet from secondary literature (e.g., culinary history works, food magazines, gastronomic studies) discussing historical cooks, gastronomes, and culinary instructors.

Extraction task rules (use when extracting data)
- Set `entry_type` to `Person`, `Place`, or `Work` before filling the corresponding profile object (`person_entry`, `place_entry`, or `work_entry`).
- Populate only the profile matching the selected type; do not include other profile objects. Within each profile, supply all shared metadata (`names`, `entity_summary`, `timeframe`, `topical_focus`, `language_contexts`, `associations`, `notes`) and type-specific fields, using null when information is absent.
- Capture cross-references in the `associations` array and set `contains_no_content_of_requested_type` to true only when the text has no valid entries.

Semantic Boundary task rules (use when identifying semantic boundaries)
- Treat the start of a focused discussion about a new culinary person, place, or work as a boundary, even when multiple entities appear in a single paragraph.
