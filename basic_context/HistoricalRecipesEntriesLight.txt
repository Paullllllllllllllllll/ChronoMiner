The input text consists of historical recipes from cookbooks, manuscripts, and culinary literature dating from approximately 1400 to 1950.
Recipes typically contain ingredient lists, cooking instructions, yields, timing notes, and occasional commentary on techniques or presentation. The text may appear in various European languages with archaic spelling and historical culinary terminology.

Extraction task rules (use when extracting data)
- Capture `recipe_text_original` verbatim and provide a full `recipe_text_modern_english` translation; retain `title_original` and `title_modern_english`, using null when no title exists.
- Assign `recipe_type` from the schema enumeration and record every ingredient in `ingredients`, including original and modern names, quantities, units, and preparation notes; use nulls where the source omits values but keep the object structure.
- Populate `cooking_methods` and `utensils_equipment` arrays with original terminology and modern English equivalents; represent absent collections with empty arrays.
- Set each boolean flag in `ingredient_categories` explicitly, basing true/false on textual evidence and defaulting to false rather than null when information is absent.
- For `culinary_style`, rate modernity 1–7, select the closest style period, and populate innovation/archaism marker arrays based on textual signals.
- For `intertextuality`, record verbatim any explicit source attributions, foreign style labels, or cross-references; assess temporal self-positioning.
- For `aspiration_practice`, rate display orientation and feasibility (1–7), identify occasion types, and note economy/luxury framing.
- For `geographic_signals`, extract place references with their function, rate regional identity strength (1–7), and flag dialect usage.
- For `tradition_rhetoric`, flag any explicit claims of tradition, authenticity, national identity, anti-foreign sentiment, or moral virtue.
- For `economic_signals`, note cost/scarcity language, record substitutions with stated reasons, and flag leftover usage.
- Provide short verbatim `evidence_quote` strings (≤150 chars, original language) for each analytical object where requested.

Semantic Boundary task rules (use when identifying semantic boundaries)
- Treat the start of a new recipe (e.g., title or text) as a boundary.
