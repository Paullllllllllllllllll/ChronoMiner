Extraction task rules (use when extracting data)
- Record `canonical_name_original` exactly as written and supply a standardized `canonical_name_modern_english`; if no modern form exists, repeat the original.
- Choose a `gender` value from the schema list and populate `roles` with all applicable controlled terms; default to `Unknown` only when the source is silent.
- List all orthographic variants in `name_variants`, and capture `period` with `start_year`, `end_year`, and `notation`, using nulls where dates or modern forms are absent.
- Include every relevant `associated_place`, `associated_work`, `source`, and `link`; represent missing collections with empty arrays rather than omitting them.
- Preserve contextual commentary in `notes` when the text offers biographical nuance or historiographical interpretation.

Semantic Boundary task rules (use when identifying semantic boundaries)
- Treat the start of a description about a new historical person as a boundary.
