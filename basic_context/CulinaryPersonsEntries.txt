Extraction task rules (use when extracting data)
- Record `names.original` exactly as written and supply a standardized `names.modern_english`; if no modern form exists, repeat the original.
- Capture `short_notes`, populate `timeframe` and `lifespan` objects with `start_year`/`end_year` or `birth_year`/`death_year`, and use nulls where values are missing while preserving the object structures.
- Populate `cultural_identity` with `nationality_original`, `nationality_modern`, and `religious_tradition`; set nulls when evidence is lacking.
- Choose a `gender` value from the schema list, fill `roles` with all applicable controlled terms, assign `historical_importance`, and retain empty arrays instead of omitting them.
- Record each associated entity in `associations` with `entity_type`, `entity_label_original`, and `relationship`, keeping the array even when empty and using `geography` to store `city_*` and `country_*` values with nulls when absent.

Semantic Boundary task rules (use when identifying semantic boundaries)
- Treat the start of a description about a new historical person as a boundary.
