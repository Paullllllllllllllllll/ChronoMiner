The input text consists of historical address book entries from Swiss cities dating from approximately 1800 to 1960.
Entries typically contain personal names, street addresses, occupations, and occasional honorifics captured in period
spelling. The text will appear mostly in Swiss German, although many names will be of foreign origin (French, Italian, etc.).
Use historical spelling and diacritics. Natural semantic markers for this type
of text are the beginnings of individual address book entries.
