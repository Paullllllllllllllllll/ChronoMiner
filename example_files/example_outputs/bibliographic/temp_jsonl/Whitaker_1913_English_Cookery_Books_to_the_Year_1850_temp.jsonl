Emprynted without temple barre by Richard Pynson in the yere of our lorde. MD.This title is given in Ames and Herbert,\u00b9 where it is stated that the Dowager Duchess of Portland brought the book from Bulstrode to London for Herbert to examine.A book called 'A noble booke of feastes royall, and of Cookeric, for Princes housholde, or any other estate, and the making thereof', is given by Maunsell\u00b2 as having been printed by John Byddell. This is doubtless the same book, and the date would be between 1533 and 1540.## 1508 HERE BEGYNNETH THE BOKE OF KERVYNGE.This book is in the Cambridge Library. The colophon is 'Here endeth the boke of servyce and kervynge and sewynge and all maner of offyce in his kynde unto a prynce or ony other estate and all the feestes in the yere.

The book was reprinted by Abraham Veale (i.e.\u00b9 Typographical Antiquities (1812 edition), ii. 420.\u00b2 The first part of the Catalogue of English printed Bookes (1595).## ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKSBetween 1558 and 1586 as *The Booke of Carvyng*, and twice by E. Allde as *The Booke of Carving and Sewing*, the first edition being without a date, the second dated 1613. These are each 12\u00b0; the former A to C in eights, the latter two A to C\u2084 in eights.The book was added in 1597 to *The second part of the Good Hus-wifes Jewell*, and in 1631 to John Murrell's *Two bookes of cookerie and carving*.The book was edited for the Early English Text Society in 1868 by F. W. Furnivall.It begins with a list of terms which are to be used by the carver, e.g. Lyft that swanne, unlace that cony, dysplaye that crane, dysfyqure that pecocke, untache that curlew, alaye that fesande, wynge that patryche, mynce that plover, and so on.Later on the duties of the butler are laid down and a list of his wines given, viz. Reed wyne, whyte wyne, clared wyne, osey, capricke, campolet, renysche wyne, malvesey, bastarde, tyet, romney, muscadell, clarrey, raspys, vernage wyne, cut, pymente, and ypocras.The chamberlain's duties are strange. 'The chaumberlayne must be dyligent & clenly in his offyce with his heed kembed & so to his soverayne that he be not reckeles & se that he have a clene sherte breche petycote and doublet. . . . And at morne whan your soverayne wyll aryse warne his shert by the fyre.' After directions as to dressing and washing his sovereign, the chamberlain is ordered to 'take your leve manerly & go to the chyrche or chapell to your soveraynes closet & laye carpentes & cuysshens & lay downe his boke of prayers'. He is then to return and make the bed, '& bete the federbedde & the bolster, but loke ye waste no feders.' After this 'se the hous of hesement be swete & clene & the prevy borde covered with a grene clothe and a cuysshyn'. Later on, after putting the sovereign to bed, 'dryve out dogge or catte & loke there be basyn and urynall set nere your soverayne, then take your leve manerly that your soverayne may take his rest meryly.'The book ends with the duties of the marshal and the usher who have to order the precedence of guests.### 1539 THE TREASURE OF POORE MENThis little book of 44 leaves contains recipes for aqua vitae and claret, but is mainly medical.### 1539 THE CASTEL OF HELTHEGathered, and made by Sir Thomas Elyot knight, out of the chief authors of Physyke, whereby every man may knowe the state of his owne body, the preservation of helthe, and# ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKShow to instruct well his phisition in sicknes, that he be not deceyved. **MD XXXIX.**This is not a cookery book, but contains advice as to the uses and physical effects of different articles of diet.

Frere.Ames and Herbert (iii. 256) give an edition of 1545, printed with Richard Lant, and Hazlitt gives one of 1546, printed by Richard Lant and Richard Bankes.The British Museum has editions of 1575 (printed by William How for Abraham Veale) and of 1576 (printed for Antony Kytson).Maunsell gives *A LITTLE OLDE BOOKE OF COOKERIE*, printed by Antony Kytson, and Ames and Herbert (iii. 571) give *A NEWE BOKE OF COKERY*, printed by Thomas Raynald. Perhaps these are editions of the same book, but the latter would be an early edition between 1540 and 1550.Some of the recipes are strange\u2014A tart of Bourage Flowers, A pye of aloes (not so alarming as it seems from the title), A tart of Marygoldes, Primroses, or Cowslips, A tart of Spinage, To make egges in mone shine.## 1558 THE SECRETS OF THE REVERENDE MAISTER ALEXIS OF PIEMONTContainyng excellente remedies against divers diseases, woundes, and other accidents, with the manner to make distilations, parfumes, confitures, diyinges, colours, fusions and meltynges.

It is dedicated to \u2018Master Richard Wistow, one of the Assistants of the Companie of the Barbers and Surgeons\u2019.One of the most striking features of the book is the number of conserves it gives and their virtues.

Thomas Newton, the translator, was Rector of Little Ilford.## 1582 A COMPENDIUM OF THE RATIONALL SECRETESof the worthie Knight and moste excellent Doctour of Phisicke and Chirurgerie, Leonardo Phioravante Bolognese, divided into three Bookes.- In the first is shewed many secretes apperteinyng unto Phisicke.- In the seconde is shewed many secretes apperteining unto Chirurgerie, with their uses.- In the third is shewed divers compositions, apperteinyng bothe to Phisicke and Chirurgerie, with the hidden vertues of sondrie vegitables, anumalles, and mineralls, and proved wel by this Authour, hetherto never set out before.Imprinted at London by Jhon Kyngston, for George Pen, and I.

The D.N.B. suggests that the 'honest Jests' were hardly such as could be dedicated by a canon to his dean. The D.N.B. mentions an edition of 1576.## 1585 (?)

In spite of the preface it is difficult to believe that a gentlewoman could have treated or even described so plainly some of the diseases mentioned. The book has no arrangement of subjects. Thus five consecutive recipes are, \"To keepe Venison from rotting\", \"To keepe Peares\", \"To kill Lice\", \"Against drunkennesse\", \"To make Linnen Cloth, or Yarne white\". A recipe for \"Diatrion Piperion\", made of pepper, time, ginger, aniseeds, &c., moves the author or authoress to poetry.> Virtutis hujus confectionis sequuntur.> This decoction is good to eate> alwaies before and after meate.> For it will make digestion good,> and turne your meate to pure blood.> Besides all this it dooth excell,> all windines to expell.> And all groce humors colde and rawe,> that are in belly, stomacke or mawe> It will dissolve without paine,> and keepe ill vapors from the braine.> Besides all this it will restore> Your memory though lost before.> Use it therefore when you please,> for therein resteth mighty ease.# ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS## 1595 (?)

'He being to preach before the university as vice-chancellor on Easter-day, April 1. 1632, was found hanging in his garters in his own chamber.' There is a portrait of him in the master's lodge.

Later editions, 1647, 1651, 1654, 1656, 1683, are printed without the borders. Hazlitt gives editions of 1600, 1603, 1618, 1640. Hugh Plat, the son of a London brewer, was born in 1552, and knighted in 1605 as a reward for his literary efforts.# ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKSThe recipes seem as charming as the book itself. 'The most kindly waie to preserve plums', 'To make a paste to keepe you moist, if you list not to drinke oft, which Ladies use to carry with them when they ride abroad', 'To candie Orange pilles', 'To make a cullis as white as snowe, and in the nature of gellie', 'Usquebash or Irish Aqua vitae', 'a Scottish handwater'.## 1607 THE ENGLISHMAN'S DOCTER, OR THE SCHOOLE OF SALERNE,or, Physicall observations for the perfect Preserving of the body of Man in continuall Health.London: Printed for John Helme, and John Busby Junior, and are to be solde at the little shoppe, next Clifford's Inne gate, in Fleet-streete. 1607.This is the earliest translation of the famous Latin poem said to have been written by the physicians of Salerno for the preservation of the health of Robert, eldest son of William the Conqueror. The commentary, written by Arnaldus de Villa Nova, who died about 1313, was translated as early as 1528 by T. Paynell. The poem is concerning the use of foods. Among other editions there is one of 1634 'whereunto is annexed a necessary Discourse of all sorts of Fish in use among us, with their effects, appertayning to the health of Man'.## 1608 A CLOSET FOR LADIES AND GENTLEWOMEN,or, The Art of preserving, Conserving, and Candying.With the manner howe to make divers kinds of Syrups: and all kind of banqueting stuffes.Also divers soveraigne Medicines and Salves, for sundry Diseases.At London, printed for Arthur Johnson, dwelling neere the great North dore of Pauls, 1608.12\u00b0; A to M in eights; pages 1-190. A little book within borders, much resembling 'Delightes for Ladies' by Plat, to whom the book is attributed in the Douce catalogue, but it looks more like a rival work.The book was reprinted in 1611, and again in 1630, 1632, and 1636 with different borders. An edition of 1647 has a portrait of a lady as frontispiece, but no borders. Later editions of 1651, 1654,# ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKSand 1656 have a table of contents, but no portrait and no borders. Hazlitt gives an edition of 1635. This book contains many tempting recipes. 'To make a Walnut, that when you cracke it, you shall find Biskets, and Carrawayes in it, or a prettie Posey written.' 'To make an excellent Marmelate which was given Queene Mary for a New-yeares gift.' 'To make another sort of Marmelate very comfortable and restorative for any Lord or Lady whatsoever.' The following seems to be the remedy of the day for appendicitis. 'For one that is taken within the body, or any place. Take Rose cakes, aqua-vitae, and rose water, heate it on a chafindish of coales, lay it to the stomacke, they shall mend by God's grace.'## 1614 THE PHILOSOPHERS BANQUETNewly furnished and decked forth with much variety of many severall Dishes, that in the former Service were neglected.

The book, which is on the uses of foods and on many other topics, is famous for being the first to contain a quotation from Hamlet. The third edition was printed for Nicholas Vavasour in 1633. The original, Mensa Philosophica, of which the first known edition is 1475, has been ascribed both to Sir Michael Scott and to Theobald Anguilbert, an Irish physician. According to a note in one of Sotheby's catalogues W. B. was probably the same person who published the 'Court of Good Counsel' in 1607, 'A Help to Discourse' in 1619, and a paraphrase of the tenth satire of Juvenal in 1617. Part of 'A Help to Discourse' is from 'The Philosophers Banquet'.## 1615 THE ENGLISH HUS-WIFEContayning, The inward and outward vertues which ought to be in a compleat woman.As, her skill in Physicke, Cookery, Banqueting-stuffe,# ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKSDistillation, Perfumes, Wooll, Hemp, Flax, Dayries, Brewing, Baking, and all other things belonging to an Houshould.A Worke very profitable and necessarie, gathered for the generall good of this kingdome.Printed at London by John Beale, for Roger Jackson, and are to bee sold at his shop neere the great Conduit in Fleet-streete, 1615.* This is the second book of 'Countrey Contentments', by Gervase Markham, who was born about 1568 and died in 1637.

An edition of 1653 was reprinted by Constance, Countess De La Warr, in 1907.The cookery recipes seem more modern than those of preceding books, although many of the dishes are obsolete, e.g. leach and jumbal. The medical recipes, however, are appalling, animal dung and other filth being frequent ingredients.## 1617 A DAILY EXERCISE FOR LADIES AND GENTLEWOMEN.Whereby they may learne and practise the whole Art of making Pastes, Preserves, Marmalades, Conserves, Tart-stuffes, Gellies, Breads, Sucket-Candies, Cordiall waters, Conceits in Sugar-workes of several kindes.As also to dry Lemonds, Orenges, or other Fruits.Newly set forth, according to the now approved Receipts, used both by Honourable and Worshipfull personages.By John Murrel Professor thereof.London: printed for the widow Helme, and are to be sould at her shop in S.

The book is a small octavo in size; A with 4 leaves, B to F\u2083 in twelves, followed by A with 4 leaves, B to E\u2084 in twelves. The copy in the British Museum looks of much later date than subsequent editions, which are of a small duodecimo size, but there was a Roger Norton printer from 1639 to 1662, so that it is difficult to regard it as a reprint. The second edition was 1653, of which there are two imprints. Other editions are 1658 (10), 1659 (11), 1661, 1663 (14), 1667 (15), 1682 (18), 1687 (19), 1708.

She died at Whitefriars on December 7, 1751.\u00b9The first book is purely medical, and recommends the usual filthy remedies, e.g. the dung of a peacock for convulsions and powdered earthworms for jaundice. It gives 'A cordiall for the Sea.

S. for Tho. Jenner at the South entrance of the Royall Exchange, London, 1653.This is a small quarto of 49 pages. The last two pages are wrongly put as 50, 51 in one of the British Museum copies, but are correct in the other. There was an edition of 1656 sold at Sotheby's a few years ago. The contents of the book are curiously arranged. There is first an engraving of the fruit or flower, and then follow recipes both in medicine and cookery which contain it. Thus the first engraving is of a lemon, and among the recipes are 'a lemmon sallet', 'Past of lemmons', 'To take away the Spots, or red Pimpels of the face', 'Sweet Bagges to lay amongst Linnen', 'To roste a Shoulder of Mutton with Lemmons'.### 1654 THE ART OF COOKERY.Refin'd and Augmented, containing an Abstract of some rare and rich unpublished Receipts of Cookery: Collected from the practice of that incomparable Master of these Arts, Mr. Jos. Cooper, chiefe Cook to the late King: With severall other practises by the Author, with an addition of Preserves, Conserves, &c., offering an infallible delight to all Judicious Readers.London, printed by F. G. for R. Lowndes at the White-lyon in St. Paul's Church-yard, neer the West end, 1654.The preface says that the title-pages of some cookery books, 'like the contents of a weekly Pamphlet, promised much more than the Books performed,' but the only thing likely to displease ladies in this book 'will be to see so many uncommon, and undeflour'd Receipts prostituted to the publique view, which might perchance ... have been plac'd better among the paper-secrets in a few of your Cabinets'.There are recipes to 'fry Skerroots', 'make a Paris-pie', 'a Pie answerable to the grand boyled meat, with 10 other pies belonging to the first'.### 1654 THE LADIES COMPANION,or, A Table furnished with sundry sorts of Pies and Tarts, gracefull at a Feast, with many excellent receipts for Preserving, Conserving, and Candying of all manner of fruits,## ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKSwith the making of Marchpanes, Marmalet, and Quindinis. By Persons of quality whose names are mentioned. London, printed by W. Bentley, and are to be sold by W. Shears, at the sign of the Bible, in S. Pauls Church yard, 1654.The peculiarity of this little book of 82 pages is that names are attached to most of the recipes, e.g. Mrs. Medgate's Broth, Mrs. Heyden's White Broth, Mrs. Atkinson's Pudding for Fridays, The Lady Butler's Cream of Almonds, The Lady Goring's Sullybub, The Lady Throgmorton's Egg Pie.### 1655 THE QUEENS CLOSET OPENEDIncomparable Secrets in Physick, Chirurgery, Preserving and Candying, and Cookery; as they were presented to the Queen, By the most experienced Persons of our Times, many whereof were honoured with her own practice, when she pleased to descend to these more private Recreations. Never before published. Transcribed from the true Copies of her Majesties own Receipt Books, by W. M., one of her late servants. Vivit post funera Virtus. Printed for Nathaniel Brook at the Angel in Cornhill, 1655.This consists of three books, *'The Pearle of Practice'*, *'A Queens Delight'*, and *'The Compleat Cook'*, the last two having separate title-pages. *'The Compleat Cook'*, nearly always separately paged, was sometimes published by itself. The other two, though sometimes separately paged, seem to have been nearly always published together.There is a portrait of Henrietta Maria Regina by Gulielmus Faithorne as frontispiece.Other editions are 1656, 1661, 1662, 1668, 1671, 1674, 1679, 1683, 1684, 1696 (10); 1710 (11), 1713 (11). In the British Museum the book is catalogued under W. M.A 1659 edition of *'The Compleat Cook'* was probably issued by itself, as the lettering of the sheets begins with A. One of 1664 begins with N.The dates on the title-pages of the second and third books do not always correspond with the date of the first title-page.The preface to the first edition begins, *'The Queens Closet opened,*# ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKSTo those Persons of Honour and Quality, that presented many of these admirable Receipts at the feet of the Queens Majesty, the Publisher resigns them with his prostrate service whilst he breaths, and is W. M. In other editions the success of the book calls on the author to give it 'a new birth', i.e. a new preface. W. M., when age will not suffer him 'to remain much longer in this troublesome world', claims to have transcribed these receipts into the Queen's own book.'The Pearle of Practice' is medical, and equals, if it does not exceed, any of its predecessors. For 'a special water for a consumption' there are used a peck of snails, a quart of earthworms, and three gallons of strong ale. 'The soiling of a Dog that is hard and white, mixed with honey' is recommended as an outward application to the throat. Superfluous hairs are removed by 'Cats dung that is hard and dryed, beaten to powder, and tempered with strong Vinegar'. The recipe for 'The Lady Gorings water for any Ague Sickness or foulness in the Stomach, and to purge the Blood' is, 'Take the Dung of a Stone-Horse that is kept in the stable when it is new made, mingle it well with Beer and a little Ginger, and a good quantity of Treacle, and distill it in an ordinary Still; Give of this a pretty draught to drink.''A Queens Delight' is 'The Art of Preserving, Conserving, and Candying', but also contains some medical recipes. It tells how 'To make a Cake the way of the Royal Princess, the Lady Elizabeth daughter to King Charles the first', and how to make 'Loroenes' and 'an Ipswitch Ball'. A mysterious thing is 'A Receipt to make Damnable Hum', unless one knows that hum was a sort of strong ale, perhaps so named from the humming it caused in the head. A damnable hum must have been a drink of dangerous strength.'The Compleat Cook' contains such interesting recipes as 'To make a Devonshire white-pot', 'To make a Outlandish dish' (hog's liver seasoned with aniseed), 'The Jacobins Pottage', 'To make a Battalia Pye', 'To make a Stumpe Pye', 'The Countesse of Rutlands Receipt of making the rare Banbury Cake, which was so much praised at her Daughters (the Lady Chaworths) wedding', 'To make a fat Lambe of a Pig', 'To make poor Knights'.## 1655 HEALTHS IMPROVEMENT:or, Rules Comprizing and Discovering the Nature, Method, and Manner of Preparing all sorts of food used in this nation. Written by that ever Famous Thomas Muffett, Doctor in Physick; Corrected and Enlarged by Christopher Bennett,## ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKSDoctor in Physick, and Fellow of the College of Physicians in London.London, printed by Tho. Newcomb for Samuel Thomson, at the sign of the White Horse in Pauls Churchyard, 1655.This is a very interesting book on the choice and preparation of food by Thomas Muffett, who was born in 1553 and died in 1604. He became M.P. for Wilton in 1597. The book bears the imprimatur of the President and Censors of the College of Physicians. It was reprinted in 1746.### 1656 THE PERFECT COOK.Being the most exact directions for the making all kind of Pastes, with the perfect way teaching how to Raise, Season, and make all sorts of Pies, Pasties, Tarts, and Florentines, etc., now practised by the most famous and expert Cooks, both French and English.As also the perfect English Cook, or right method of the whole Art of Cookery, with the true ordering of French, Spanish, and Italian Kickshaws, with Alamode varieties for Persons of Honour.To which is added, the way of dressing all manner of Flesh, Fowl, and Fish, and making admirable Sauces, after the most refined way of French and English.The like never extant;With fifty-five ways of dressing of Eggs.By Mounsieur Marnette.Printed at London for Nath. Brooks at the Angel in Cornhil, 1656.There is a frontispiece of two men and a woman in a kitchen, engraved by Ro. Vaughan. A later edition of 1686 has no frontispiece, and probably this edition did not have one.From the preface we see that the author was born in London of foreign parents, and was 'turned young into the wild and Military World, to become a Son of Mars'. After a time he returned to London and resigned himself 'to Minerva's milder tuition and protection'. He apologizes for presenting a book on pastry 'to this Nation, where every Matron and young Damsel are so well vers'd.# ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKSin the Pastry Art, as that they may out-vie the best Forreign Pastry Cooks in all the World besides.The book seems to be the one mentioned in London's Catalogue of the most vendible books (1657) as 'The French and English cooke, for exact making all sorts of pasts, pasties, Florentines, &c. ordering of French, Spanish, and Italian kickshawes, dressing, flesh, fowle, and fish; with admirable sawces 120'.The first part of the book is a translation of *Le Pastissier fran\u00e7ois*, which was published in 1653. An Amsterdam edition of 1655 has the same frontispiece as the English edition and the original of its preface. There are recipes for making Chossons, Flawns, Rattoones, Darioles, Poupelains, Tourrons, buttered Wiggs, Gamby Bisket, and the good Wives Tart or a Tart for a friend in a corner, all of which seem very good. The 55 ways of dressing eggs include 'an Omelet according to the newest mode, Oxford Gates, or the Covent Garden guise'.## 1658 ARCHIMAGIRUS ANGLO-GALLICUS:Excellent & approved Receipts and Experiments in CookeryTogether with the best way of Preserving.As also, Rare Formes of Sugar-works:According to the French Mode, and English Manner.Copied from a choice Manuscript of Sir Theodore Mayerne Knight, Physician to the late K. Charles.Magistro Artis, Edere est Esse.Printed for G. Bedell, and T. Collins, and are to be sold at their shop at the Middle-Temple-Gate, in Fleet-street, 1658.Sir Theodore Turquet de Mayerne was born at Mayerne, near Geneva, in 1573. He came to London in 1606, and was appointed physician first to the queen and then to the king. He died at Chelsea in 1655. Most, if not all, of the recipes are copied from earlier books. The compiler, who doubtless invented the fiction of a Mayerne manuscript, in a learned preface quotes Plato and Plautus.## 1660 THE ACCOMPLISHT COOK,Or the Art and Mystery of Cookery. Wherein the whole Art is revealed in a more easie and perfect Method, then hath been publisht in any Language, Expert and ready wayes## ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKSFor the dressing of all sorts of flesh, fowl, and fish; the raising of pastes; the best directions for all manner of kickshaws, and the most poignant sauces; with the terms of carving and sewing.

London, printed by R. W. for Nath. Brooke, at the Sign of the Angel in Cornhill, 1660.Other editions are 1665 (2), 1671 (3), of which there are two imprints, 1678 (4), 1685 (5).As frontispiece there is a portrait with '\u00c6tatis Su\u00e6 71, 1660' in background, and beneath are the lines:> What! wouldst thou view but in one face> all hospitalitie, the race> of those that for the Gusto stand,> whose tables a whole Ark comand> of Nature's plentie, wouldst thou see> this sight, peruse May's booke, tis hee.>> Ja. ParryFor Nathaniel Brooke, att the Angell in Cornhill.According to Granger (Biog. Hist. iv. 68) the portrait is by Gaywood. Southey quotes the title-page in Omniana, ii. 70.There are two poems at the beginning in May's honour, and a story of his life which mentions that he was the son of a cook and was trained in France. This training accounts for his giving nine recipes for preparing snails and one for baking frogs. In the preface May says that 'God and my own Conscience would not permit me to bury these my Experiences in the Grave', and that 'The Queens Closet Opened' was the only book comparable to his own.### 1661 THE WHOLE BODY OF COOKERY DISSECTEDTaught, and fully manifested, methodically, artificially, and according to the best tradition of the English, French, Italian, Dutch, &c.Or, a Sympathie of all varieties in Naturall Compounds in that Mysterie.ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKSWherein is contained certain Bills of Fare for the Seasons of the year, for Feasts and Common Diets.Whereunto is annexed a Second Part of Rare Receipts of Cookery; With certain useful Traditions.With a Book of Preserving, Conserving and Candying, after the most Exquisite and Newest manner: Delectable for Ladies and Gentlewomen.London, printed by R. W. for Giles Calvert, at the sign of the black Spread Eagle, at the West end of Pauls, 1661.This book is by William Rabisha, who describes himself as 'Master Cook to many honourable Families before and since the wars began, both in this my Native Countrey, and with Embassadors and other Nobles in certain forraign patts'.Other editions are 1673, 1675 (2). Watt gives one of 1682. The editions of 1661 and 1673 are in the Bodleian, but not in the B. M.There is a long poem in commendation of the author, two of the lines being:> His Broths, Pottages, to the taste and sight,> Would Esau-like, make some to sell their right.It is a well-arranged book, giving recipes 'to pickle Sleep-at-noon', to make 'Punnado' and 'Andolians', 'to fry Primrose-leaves in March with eggs', 'to Spitchcoch an Eel'. Near the end are 'Certain old useful Traditions of Carving and Sewing, &c.' which come from the 'Book of Carving' of 1508, and a dreadful recipe 'to roast a shoulder of Mutton in blood'.### 1661 THE LADIES DIRECTORY,In Choice Experiments & Curiosities of Preserving and Candying both Fruits & Flowers.

By Hanna Woolley, who hath had the Honour to perform such things the Entertainment of His late Majesty, as well as for the Nobility.To prevent Counterfeits: Take Notice, that these books are no where to be had, but from the Authress, and at Peter Drings at the Sun in the Poultery, Book-seller;32# ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKSand at Tho. Milbourns, Printer, in Jewen Street near Aldersgate-Street: Who also sells for her, a most excellent Cordial-Powder, and very sovereign Pils, London, printed by Tho. Milbourn for the Authress 1661.There is another edition of 1662, which has a frontispiece representing a lady and her cook in a kitchen.This is the first book by this authoress, who, according to the D. N. B., was married at the age of 24 to one Woolley, who had been master of the free school at Newport, and was married in 1666 to a Francis Challinor, of St. Margaret's, Westminster. Granger (Biog. Hist. v. 308) expresses doubt as to the real authorship of the books ascribed to her. In the preface she speaks of 'this little Book, which though but little, containeth more than all the books that ever I saw Printed in this Nature, they being rather Confounders than Instructers'.## 1663 A BOOK OF KNOWLEDGEIn three parts, &c., &c.Composed by Samuel Strangehopes.London, printed for Charles Tyns, at the 'three Bibles on London-Bridge, 1663.This book, of which there were several editions, contains a few recipes.## 1664 THE COOKS GUIDE:or, Rare Receipts for Cookery.

Milbourn, for Randal Taylor in St. Martins Le Grand, 1664.A manuscript note in the B. M. copy says there should be a print as frontispiece. The paging and the lettering of the sheets are both irregular.A long and learned introduction, quoting Epictetus and Plato, is an attack on the family of Cromwell, but its object must have been to act as an advertisement of the book, which is nothing but an ordinary cookery book. The recipes are introduced by this preface, 'Here followes the most usual Meat and Diet observed at her Table, most of them ordinary and vulgar, except some few Rarities, but such as arried her Palate and Expense, of which it will be no unpleasing Labour to the Reader, to peruse the Cookery, and manner of Dressing, as also her Preserves, &c.' Two recipes have a definite personal reference attached, 'How to make Scotch Collops of Veal (this was almost her constant Dish)', 'How to make Marrow Puddings (which she usually had to her Breakfast)'.## (1664) THE GENTLEWOMANS CABINET UNLOCKED,Wherein is contained many excellent Receipts for neat Dressing of divers sorts of Meats; as Flesh and Fish, with their Proper Sauces. Also Directions for the best way of making- Pancakes- Fritters- Tansies- Puddings- Custards- Cheesecakes(And such like fine Knacks.)And other Delicate Dishes, which are most frequently used in Gentlemens Houses.Printed for W. Thackeray and T. Passenger.Passenger succeeded to the business of Charles Tyas, his former master in 1664. Thackeray was in business in 1666.## ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKSThe seventh edition was 1675, and the eighth was 1673, probably a misprint for 1678.This is a small 8\u00ba, A to B\u2084, merely a compilation of a few recipes from previous books.### 1668 CHOICE AND EXPERIMENTED RECEIPTSIn Physick and Chirurgery, as also Cordial and Distilled Waters and Spirits, Perfumes, and other Curiosities, Collected by the Honourable and truly learned Sir Kenelm Digby, Kt., Chancellour to Her Majesty the Queen Mother. Translated out of several Languages, by G. H. London, printed for the Author, and are to be sold by H. Brome, at the Star in Little Britain, 1668.The second edition was 1675. Sir Kenelm Digby was born in 1603 and died in 1665. He was one of the first fellows of the Royal Society, but seems to have been something of a mountebank, as Evelyn termed him. George Hartman was his steward according to Arber\u2019s Term Catalogues, ii. 16.There is a portrait by Cross as frontispiece. This book is mainly medical and contains recipes, some of which are even more filthy and superstitious than those of any preceding books. \u2018A Sympathetick cure of the Tooth-ach. With an Iron-nail raise and cut the gum from about the Teeth, till it bleed, and that some of the blood stick upon the nail; then drive it into a wooden beam up to the head: After this is done, you never shall have the tooth-ach in all your life.\u2019### 1669 THE CLOSET OF THE EMINENTLY LEARNED**SIR KENELME DIGBY, KT., OPENED:**Whereby is Discovered several Ways for making of Metheglin, Sider, Cherry-Wine, together with Excellent Directions for Cookery, as also for Preserving, Conserving, Candying. Published by his Son\u2019s Consent. London, printed by E. C. for H. Brome, at the Star in Little Britain, 1669.There is a portrait of Digby as frontispiece in this edition and the one of 1671. It is doubtful if the third edition (1677) had it.An edition catalogued in the Bodleian as 1699 has 1669 on its title-page, but the third figure looks as if it had been altered with a pen. The title-page is a little different from the one given above.# ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKSThe book was reprinted in 1910.The peculiarity of the book is the number of recipes for making drinks. There are nearly fifty recipes for making meath, and as many for making metheglin, in addition to recipes for hydromel, stepony, bragot, strawberry wine, cock-ale, &c. There is a recipe for making tea with eggs, and a warning against leaving tea to stand too long. 'The water is to remain upon it no longer than whiles you can say the Miserere Psalm very leisurely.'## 1670 THE QUEEN-LIKE CLOSETor Rich Cabinet: Stored with all manner of Rare Receipts for Preserving, Candying and Cookery.

The third, fourth, and fifth editions have a supplement or 'A little of everything', separately paged and dated respectively 1674, 1680, and 1684.There is not much that is new in this book except a recipe 'To make Misers for children to eat in afternoons in Summer'. At the end are directions for servants. The supplement contains the autobiography of Mrs. Wolley, a letter-writer, &c.## 1672 THE LADIES DELIGHT,or, a Rich Closet of Choice Experiments & Curiosities, containing the Art of Preserving & Candying both Fruits and Flowers: Together with The Exact Cook, or The Art of Dressing all sorts of Flesh, Fowl, and Fish.

Crouch, in Exchange-Alley over against the Royall-Exchange in Cornhil, 1672.This is a new edition in one volume of 'The Ladies Directory' and 'The Cooks Guide'. The frontispiece is the same as in the 1662 edition of 'The Ladies Directory'. There was a German translation of this book printed at Hamburg in 1674.## ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS### 1673 THE GENTLEWOMANS COMPANIONOr, a guide to the Female Sex: containing Directions of Behaviour, in all Places, Companies, Relations, and Conditions, from their Childhood down to Old Age, viz., as,- Children to Parents.- Scholars to Governours.- Single to Servants.- Virgins to Suitors.- Married to Husbands.- Huswifes to the House.- Mistresses to Servants.- Mothers to Children.- Widows to the World.- Prudent to all.With Letters and Discourses upon all Occasions.

According to authorities quoted by the D. N. B. the lady is one Sarah Gilly.Less than a sixth part of the book is devoted to cookery recipes. The introduction gives an account of the life of the authoress. 'Before I was Fifteen I was intrusted to keep a little School, and was the sole Mistress thereof.'The book was reprinted in 1711 under the title of **THE COMPLEAT GENTLEWOMAN**. To it was added 'The Way to get Wealth, shewing how a Man may live plentifully for Two pence a Day'. This is a miscellaneous supplement, the value of which may be calculated by the cure for the bite of a mad dog.

A book with the same title was published in 1783, but is an entirely different work.This book is neither original nor well arranged. Later editions are much enlarged and contain arithmetical tables and other additions. The medical receipts are expanded into a supplement called 'Every one their own Physician: or, Charity made pleasant, by relieving their own Family, or poor neighbouring People, by cheap, easy, and safe Remedies'. A preface to this supplement is signed 'Mary Morris'. The third recipe, one for ague, prejudices one at the start against Mary Morris.

The cookery part is well arranged, the medical part is full of horrors. The treatment for appendicitis is to 'apply a live puppy to the naked belly' and follow up with a cataplasm of rotten apples or of 'sheeps-dung boil'd with milk'.# ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS## 1743 A PRESENT FOR A SERVANT-MAIDOr, The Sure Means of gaining Love and Esteem.Under the following Heads:- Observance.- Avoiding Sloth.- Sluttishness.- Staying on Errands.- Telling Family Affairs.- Secrets among Fellow-Servants.- Entering into their Quarrels.- Tale-bearing.- Being an Eye-Servant.- Carelessness of Children.- Of Fire, Candle, Thieves.- New Acquaintance.- Fortune-Tellers.- Giving Saucy Answers.- Liquorishness.- Apeing the Fashion.- Dishonesty.- The Market-Penny.- Delaying to give Change.- Giving away Victuals.- Bringing in Chair-women.- Washing Victuals.- Quarrels with Fellow-Servants.- Behaviour to the Sick.- Hearing Things against a Master or Mistress.- Being too free with Men-Servants.- Conduct towards Apprentices.- Mispending Time.- Publick Shews.- Vails.- Giving Advice too freely.- Chastity.- Temptations from the Master.- If a Single Man.- If a Married Man.- If from the Master's Son.- If from Gentlemen Lodgers.To which are added Directions for going to Market: Also,For Dressing any Common Dish, whether Flesh, Fish or Fowl.With some Rules for Washing, &c.The whole calculated for making both the Mistress and the Maid happy.London, printed and publish'd by T.

The original book is on an entirely new plan. There are 366 bills of fare, and following each is the method of cooking the several dishes. There is a half-title. Our forefathers must have risen early, as the preface advises that 'in the summer time, cooks should be very exact with the butchers; and make them bring their meat in not later than six o'clock in the morning'.### 1807 THE FAMILY DIRECTOR;or, Housekeeper's Assistant: containing upwards of Three Hundred Original Receipts, in Pastry, Pickling, Preserving, Collaring, Making Wines, &c,By Addison Ashburn.Coventry, printed for the Author by N.

'A white hand is a very desirable ornament; and a hand can never be white unless it be kept clean. Nor is this all; for if the young lady will excel her companions in this respect, she must keep her hands in constant motion, which will occasion the blood to circulate freely, and have a wonderful effect. The motion I would recommend, is working at her needle, brushing up the house, or twirling the distaff.

The 'advertisement' to the fourth edition gives the date. The head-line is 'Nourse's Cookery'. It is a small octavo of 336 pages, and seems a good book. 'Chopin' is used for quart and 'mutchkin' for pint. Blackwoods published an edition in 1838, but can trace no earlier edition as published by them.## 1820 TABELLA CIBARIAThe Bill of Fare: a Latin poem, implicitly translated and fully explained in copious and interesting Notes, relating to the Pleasures of Gastronomy, and the mysterious Art of Cookery.*Ipsa memor praecepta canam; celabitur auctor.*\u2014Hor.London, published by Sherwood, Neely, and Jones, Pater-noster Row; J.

The notes are very interesting.

The author has an extraordinary theory that the word fish when met with in the Gospel history should be taken to mean water-melon or lotus-plant. He considers that abstinence from animal food would abolish war, 'for those who are so conscientious as not to kill animals, will never murder human beings.' The medical recipes are poor. 'A roasted onion applied to the top of the head will frequently relieve the most violent pain.' 'A small bag of saffron worn at the stomach prevents sea-sickness.' For dysentery, 'Take a sheet of writing-paper, cut it in slips, boil it in a pint and a half of milk to a pint; take it at twice.'## 1821 CULINARY CHEMISTRYExhibiting the scientific principles of cookery, with concise instructions for preparing good and wholesome Pickles, Vinegar, Conserves, Fruit Jellies, Marmalades, and various other Alimentary Substances employed in Domestic Economy, with observations on the chemical constitution and nutritive qualities of different kinds of food.# ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKSWith copper plates.By Frederick Accum, operative chemist, lecturer on practical chemistry, on mineralogy, and on chemistry applied to the arts and manufactures; member of the Royal Irish Academy; fellow of the Linnaean Society; member of the Royal Academy of Sciences, and of the Royal Society of Arts, Berlin, &c. &c.London, published by R.

He was right in one sense; for the Disquisitions and Treatises with which our Libraries are filled, are often merely the husks and shells of knowledge; but it would be to be wished, that before he were permitted to bore his hole, some literary analysts should select all the Facts, Recipes, and Prescriptions, useful to Man, and condense them into a portable Volume. **Locke.**By Colin Mackenzie, author of One thousand experiments in manufactures and chemistry.London, printed for Sir Richard Phillips and Co. and to be had of all booksellers. 1823.Price 10s. 6d.

The preface claims that the book is practical and different from most others, concerning which 'a young female, just returned from the hymeneal altar, is ready to exclaim on the first perusal, as the philosopher did who visited the metropolis, How many things are here which I do not want'. The preface is full of interest. 'It is in general a good maxim, to select servants not younger than thirty.' 'The master or mistress who wishes to enjoy the rare luxury of a table well served in the best stile, should treat the cook as a friend; should watch over her health with peculiar care, and be sure that her taste does not suffer, by her stomach being deranged by bilious attacks. A small proportion of that attention usually bestowed on a favourite horse, or even a dog, would suffice to regulate her animal system.'## 1823 THE FOOTMAN'S DIRECTORY,and Butler's Remembrancer; or, the Advice of Onesimus to his young Friends: comprising Hints on the Arrangement and Performance of their Work; Rules for setting out Tables and Sideboards; the Art of waiting at Table, and conducting large and small Parties; Directions for cleaning Plate, Glass, Furniture, Clothes, and all other Things which come within the Care of a Man-Servant; and Advice respecting Behaviour to Superiors, Tradespeople, and Fellow-Servants.With an Appendix, comprising various useful Receipts and Tables.London, printed for the Author; and sold by J.
