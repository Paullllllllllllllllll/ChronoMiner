For besieged towns the author gives a recipe for 'broth cakes, which may be conveniently carried about, and preserv'd above a year'.

Full Title: ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS
Month of the Year, that no Person need be at a Loss to provide an agreeable Variety of Dishes.
By Mrs. Sarah Harrison of Devonshire.
London, printed for T. Worrall, at Judge Coke's Head, over against St. Dunstan's Church, Fleetstreet. 1733.(Price 2s. 6d. bound.)
Other editions are 1739 (2), 1748 (4), 1751 (5), 1755 (6), 1757 (also 6), 1760 (7), 1764 (8), 1777 (9). A book with the same title was published in 1783, but is an entirely different work.
This book is neither original nor well arranged. Later editions are much enlarged and contain arithmetical tables and other additions. The medical receipts are expanded into a supplement called 'Every one their own Physician: or, Charity made pleasant, by relieving their own Family, or poor neighbouring People, by cheap, easy, and safe Remedies'. A preface to this supplement is signed 'Mary Morris'. The third recipe, one for ague, prejudices one at the start against Mary Morris. 'Take a Spider alive, cover it with new soft crummy Bread without bruising it; let the Patient swallow it fasting. This is an effectual Cure, but many are set against it.'
