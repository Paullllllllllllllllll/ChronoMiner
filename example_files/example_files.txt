# Example Files

This directory contains example input and output files that demonstrate how to
use ChronoMiner for structured data extraction.

## Input Files

| Directory | Source | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `example_inputs/addressbooks/` | [1900 Bern Address Book](https://www.e-rara.ch/bes_1/content/titleinfo/1704646) | Excerpt of a Swiss address book from 1900 |
| `example_inputs/occupationrecords/` | Brazilian military records (São Paulo) | Three occupation records, kindly provided by Dr. Bruno Witzel Gabriel de Sousa |
| `example_inputs/bibliographic/` | Whitaker, *English Cookery Books to the Year 1850* (1913) | Digitised bibliographic catalogue |

We do not provide an example of an academic publication for reasons of copyright.

## Schema Mapping

Each input set maps to a specific JSON extraction schema:

| Input | Schema |
|---|---|
| 1900 Bern address book | `HistoricalAddressBookEntries` |
| Brazilian military occupation records | `BrazilianMilitaryRecords` |
| English Cookery Books to the Year 1850 | `BibliographicEntries` |

## Output Files

Pre-generated outputs are provided in `example_outputs/` in four formats per
input file: JSON, CSV, DOCX, and TXT. These were produced with `gpt-5-mini`
using default settings (`main/process_text_files.py`).

We recommend experimenting with these files before adding custom schemas.
