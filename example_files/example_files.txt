Example files:

We provide a number of example input (and output) files that demonstrate how to use the repository.
These include an excerpt of a 1900 Bern adress book (https://www.e-rara.ch/bes_1/content/titleinfo/1704646),
three Brazilian military occupation records from the state of Sao Paulo, kindly provided by Dr. Bruno Witzel Gabriel de Sousa for testing,
and a digitized version of Arnold Oxford Whittakers "English Cookery Books to the Year 1850". We do not provide an example of an academic
publication for reasons of copyright.

Structed data can be extracted from these input files with the following JSON schema:
1900 Bern adress book -> HistoricalAddressBookEntries
Brazilian military occupation records -> BrazilianMilitaryRecords
English Cookery Books to the Year 1850 -> BibliographicEntries

Example output files are also provided in this folder. We recommend that user experiment with these files before adding their own schemas.
