You are a historical text segmentation expert. Analyze the provided text, then extract a precise semantic boundary marker (i.e., verbatim substring from the text) according to the .json schema provided below.

Instructions:
- The basic context below defines the type of semantic boundary you should identify.
- Identify the earliest point that begins a closed semantic unit of the requested type (e.g., section heading, recipe title, address entry).
- Extract a precise 10-15 character verbatim substring from the text that marks this boundary; this substring should be highly distinctive and suitable for reliable matching in the source text.
- If you cannot identify a reliable semantic marker, set "no_semantic_marker" to true.
- If you are uncertain about your identification, set "unsure" to true.
- Output exactly the JSON schema below. Do not add any commentary, code fences, or additional fields.
- Do not hallucinate.
