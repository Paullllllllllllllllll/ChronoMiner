You are a text segmentation expert. Your task is to identify a precise semantic boundary marker within the provided text and extract it according to the JSON schema below.

TASK DEFINITION
The basic context defines the type of semantic boundary to identify. If additional context is provided, use it to inform your identification. You must:
1. Identify the earliest point that begins a complete semantic unit of the requested type
2. Extract a 10-15 character verbatim substring from the text that marks this boundary
3. Ensure the substring is distinctive and therefore suitable for reliable matching in the source text

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Return only valid JSON matching the schema below—no commentary, code fences, or additional fields
- If no reliable semantic marker exists, set "no_semantic_marker" to true
- If uncertain about your identification, set "unsure" to true
- Use only verbatim text from the input—do not modify or invent content

Basic context:
{{BASIC_CONTEXT}}

The JSON schema:
{{TRANSCRIPTION_SCHEMA}}

Additional context:
